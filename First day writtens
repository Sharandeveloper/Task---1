1 . Difference between Http1.1 and http2 :
      Multiplexing: HTTP1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be
loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.                                                                          In
contrast, HTTP2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at
once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
2.write about of objects  and internal representation in javascript :
        
        Objects are important data types in javascript. Objects are different than
primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.). Primitive data types
contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value
pair.
3.codekata practice :
      
   Code Kata is an attempt to bring this element of practice to software development. A kata is
an exercise in karate where you repeat a form many, many times, making little improvements in
each. The intent behind code kata is similar.  Some involve programming, and can be coded in
many different ways. Some are open ended, and involve thinking about the issues behind
programming.
4.about the IP address, port, HTTPmethods and mac address :
        Both MAC and IP addresses are operated on different layers of the internet protocol suite.
The MAC address works on layer 2 and helps identify the devices within the same broadcast
network (such as the router). On the other hand, the IP addresses are used on layer 3 and help
identify the devices on different networks.
